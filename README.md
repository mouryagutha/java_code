# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is designed to solve specific computational problems efficiently, with an emphasis on clean code and performance optimization. The repository serves as a continuous learning journey, showcasing my understanding and problem-solving approach in the field of computer science.

## Contents
- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Graphs
  - HashMaps
  - Heaps

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms (Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)
  - Recursion and Backtracking (N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

## Approach
For each problem or data structure, I follow a structured approach:
1. **Problem Understanding:** Grasp the problem statement and constraints.
2. **Algorithm Design:** Plan an efficient solution using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
3. **Implementation:** Write clean and modular code in Java.
4. **Testing:** Verify the solution with various test cases to ensure correctness.
5. **Optimization:** Analyze the time and space complexity and optimize if possible.

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code files organized by data structure or algorithm type.
- **tests/**: Includes JUnit test cases for each implementation.
- **docs/**: Documentation and explanations for complex problems and solutions.
  
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mouryagutha/java_master.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory and explore the code:
    ```bash
    cd java_master/src
    ```
3. Compile and run the code or tests:
    ```bash
    javac YourClassName.java
    java YourClassName
